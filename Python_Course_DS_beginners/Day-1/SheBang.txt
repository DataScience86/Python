Sometime comments are introduced by the hash mark or the pound sign, 
and the first comment is a special case of a comment. It's called a 
shebang line or sometimes hashbang.

The shebang line is a common pattern for Unix based systems. 
It allows a script to be invoked from the command line. There 
are two parts to the shebang line. The hash mark and the exclamation 
sign must be the first two characters on the first line of the file. 
These marks together form the shebang. An exclamation mark is sometimes 
called a bang, so hash plus bang is where the word shebang comes from. 
There must be no lines before this line, and no spaces before these first 
two characters.

example :
#!/usr/bin/env python3
