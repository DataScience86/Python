# Managing_widget_placement
""" There are three(3) ways to manage widgets
    1. Pack Geometry Manager - Basic commands to place the widgets
        example: widget.pack(side = RIGHT)

    2. grid Geometry Manager - Divides the master into row/columns IE into
        2-dimensional table.
        example: widget.grid(row = 0, colum = 1)

    3. Place Geometry Manager - Defines relative or absolute x/y coordinates
        in master. It can be bit complicated.
        example: widget.place(x = 200, y = 150) 

* It is possible to two or more geometry managers.
